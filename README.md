# New_York_Noise_Lib: Urban Sound Classification Dataset

This dataset is curated for the classification of common environmental and urban noise disturbances. It contains **100 labeled audio samples** organized into **10 categories**, based on the ten most frequently reported noise complaints from the NYC 311 dataset, and each with **10 recordings**. All audio files are **5 seconds long** and sampled at **44.1 kHz**.

- Each category is stored in its own folder named after the sound label.
- The `metadata.csv` file provides additional metadata for each audio sample.

## üßæ Metadata Fields

The `metadata.csv` includes the following columns:

| Column        | Description                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `filename`    | Relative path to the audio file (e.g., `Loud Music (Party)/1-1.wav`) |
| `label`       | Human-readable label for the sound category                   |
| `duration_s`  | Duration of the clip in seconds (always 5)                    |
| `sample_rate` | Audio sampling rate (always 44100 Hz)                         |
